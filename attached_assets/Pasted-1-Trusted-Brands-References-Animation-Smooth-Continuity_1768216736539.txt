1. Trusted Brands / References Animation (Smooth Continuity Fix)
Current Problem

The rotating text/logos can be paused on hover, but:

When the mouse leaves, the animation restarts from the beginning

When the user drags (scrolls) the animation manually and releases it, the animation resets to the start

This breaks visual continuity and feels unnatural and non-fluid

Required Behavior (Very Important)

The animation must resume from the exact position where it was stopped

Whether the animation is:

Paused via hover

Moved manually via mouse drag

➡️ When the mouse leaves the animation area, it must continue from the last position, not restart

Functional Requirements

Auto-scrolling animation (right to left) by default

On hover:

Animation pauses smoothly

On mouse drag:

User can move the carousel freely (left / right)

On mouse release or mouse leave:

Animation continues from the current position

No “snapshot reset” or jump back to the beginning

Motion must feel:

Continuous

Fluid

Natural

Think of it like a real, infinite marquee that never resets its position.

2. Translation (i18n) – Critical Fixes
Global Requirement

Translation must work everywhere in the application, including:

Header

Body content

Footer

All pages

No hardcoded text should remain

All static and dynamic texts must be included in the translation system

Footer Translation Issue

The footer section is currently not translated at all

Footer content must fully respond to language changes

Specific Untranslated Texts (Must Be Fixed)

Ensure the following sections are fully translated:

Homepage

“GÜVENEN MARKALAR” title

Under “WHY DIGITAL?”

All items under Traditional

All items under PDF

Under “e-Brochure”

“%100 Digital”

“Native feel”

Pages (Entire Pages Not Translating)

Brochures page (entire page)

Custom Design page (entire page)

Pricing page (entire page)

Contact Section

Translate the following labels:

“Email Us”

“Call Us”

“Visit Us”

Translation System Requirements

Use a centralized i18n structure

No inline or hardcoded strings

Language switch must instantly update:

Visible content

Footer

Page-specific content

Ensure consistency across all pages

3. Overall Expectation

Smooth, premium SaaS-level user experience

No animation resets unless the page is refreshed

Language switching should feel reliable and complete

The product should feel polished, stable, and professional
