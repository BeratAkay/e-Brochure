Dashboard Update

Replace the image used in the dashboard with the provided screenshot

Use the exact uploaded image instead of any placeholder or stock visuals

Ensure the dashboard visual looks clean, professional, and aligned with the overall UI

Language Selector (UX Improvement)

Convert the language selection area into a single button

When the user clicks this button, display the available language options in a dropdown or popover menu

The interaction should feel modern and minimal, not static

The language selector should be easily accessible but visually clean

Translation (Critical Functional Fix)

Fix translation issues across the entire application

Currently, some text sections are not translated properly, for example:

The text under “Why Digital?”

Feature descriptions under “e-Brochure”, such as:

Low cost

Instant publishing

Real-time updates

These texts remain unchanged when switching languages

Requirements:

Translation must work consistently on every page and every section

No hardcoded text should remain untranslated

Use a centralized translation system (i18n structure)

Ensure all dynamic and static texts are included in translation files

Trusted Brands / References Section

Improve the rotating “Trusted Brands” / references carousel

In addition to auto-scrolling:

Allow users to pause the animation on hover

Enable manual control with mouse drag (click and drag left/right)

The interaction should feel smooth, responsive, and dynamic

The carousel must resume auto-scrolling after user interaction

Logo Redesign

Replace the current rocket-based logo

The rocket concept does not align well with the product vision

New logo requirements:

More suitable for a digital brochure / retail / marketing product

Simple, modern, and professional

Reflects concepts such as:

Digital catalogs

Fast content creation

Smart retail marketing

Must work well in:

Header

Dashboard

Favicon

Social sharing previews

Overall Expectations

Maintain a modern, SaaS-style design

Prioritize usability and clarity

Ensure visual consistency across all pages

The application should feel reliable, professional, and business-ready
